		bio = "[Pivotal](https://pivotal.io) was created in 2013 as a spin-off of EMC and VMware, with a $105m investment from GE. Raytheon uses Pivotal's Greenplum MPP database (formerly EMC Greenplum) today in IIS customer solutions. We are the creators of the Spring framework and Cloud Foundry PaaS, which was made commercially available and open sourced in mid 2014. Pivotal Labs is our extreme agile development division (600 people, 16 global Labs), founded 20 years ago in Silicon Valley. Our whole big data suite has now been open sourced. "
